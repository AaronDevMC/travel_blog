Welcome to my blog,
I will soon finish school and plan on taking a gap year which is why I chose to create this blog, in which I will share the results of the gap year and the experiences I'll make during it!
I hope you will enjoy this journey just as much as I do!

## About myself

Hi, I'm Aaron, you might not really care about this blog but I very much do. I'll write my a-levels ('!hide'richiger name??) in a few weeks and feel pretty good about them.
I already reached out to the first colleges years ago and got some promising responses at the time. I intend to major in computer science with a focus on developing applications after finishing the gap year.
Now that I have chosen the college I want to go to and a large chunk of my life laid out before me, I want to take the only chance I have to see the world before retiring (spelling?) many years from now.

## Travel Plans

So, for my gap year I have chosen to do everything in the most compact from I can, for about half the year I have a tight scheudle of visiting a place, seeing what is to be seen and basically filling
a mental list with checkmarks about what things a classical tourist should be doing. Have a little part of my list for your enjoyment.

```
    [ ] See the leaning tower of Pisa
    [ ] Visit the eifel tower
    [ ] Disaster Tourism
        [ ] See a volcano
        [ ] Go somewhere, where for some reason no one is left (and that looks like it was built by humans)
    [ ] Visit the US
```

After having finished as much of that as I can in 10 months, I will then just live the last two months to the fullest and just see, what I happen to encounter.

## Addendum

Hey, it's me from the future here and [it's](https://speakspeak.com/grammar-articles/its-is-has-difference) been a crazy few months! If you cared about my plans you should definetly check up on my [conclusion](https://travelblogftw.netlify.app/conclusion) to this gap year I have taken.
