## Finally, a *nice* place :/

Welcome back to my blog, it's been a hot few months since my last post.
While we're at the topic of hot, let's get back to the scorching situation at hand. The erupting volcano I ended up at. It's safe to say that finding myself at the foot of a spewing mountain was not exactly what I had in mind, having just escaped an infinite sprawl of hallways without end, the volcano wasn't the most shocking thing I had faced, but being as dehydrated and exhausted as I was, the ground trembling beneath my feet and the air being thick with the acidic scent of smoke and sulfur was far more dangerous to me than it could have been if those last few months weren't so stressful.

It really was a surreal sight, seeing molten lava cascading down the volcano's slopes, painting the night sky with an ominous glow while I was only a mere 20 metres away from the gooey liquid, that was emmiting the terrible heat and smell.

As you can imagine, survival continued to be my top priority, with the environment becoming my greatest danger now instead of the creatures inhabiting ('!hide' vtl. lurking?) it. I was surrounded by a barren landscape, devoid of any signs of civilization or human touch, with reddish smoke covering the ground and stopping my line of sight a mere 15 metres from me. The intense heat made every breath a challenge, and I was constantly on the lookout for potential hazards. The ground was treacherous to travel on, with pockets of scalding steam venting from hidden crevices. And the stone cracking under my feet to reveal hot steam from far below.

Navigating this desolate terrain required caution and resourcefulness. I had managed to find shelter in a small cave on the volcano's outskirts, providing some respite from the scorching temperatures. However, it was far from comfortable, and I have to remain vigilant in case the situation worsens.

So, this took place a few weeks ago and I've since traveled the wasteland farther and farther, escaping the head and the terrible smell to find a research station on the outskirts of the wasteland. The scientists were shocked, that someone had come so close to the volcano as I showed them the two photos I made made. You can see those photos here

Here you have a photo of me finding the research station (I wanted to make sure I wasn't halucinating)

I have been told, that I will not be able to continue my gap year for another three months, which is also when it will end. While being disappointed at missing what I had planned, I am excited what I had managed to accomplish in those few months.

Expect a conclusion to all that happend at the end of the year (wouldn't want to break my scheudule, would I?).
