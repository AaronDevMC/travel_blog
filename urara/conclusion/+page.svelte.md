## Update

I've had a speedy recovery so far and at the time of writing this I am back to being healty again. While my plans for the 10th months had to be cancelled, I luckily didn't have anything planned for month 11 and 12 of the year (for reasons see my first entry).

## Concluding my gap year - a most interesting experience ('!hide'Ein bisschen zu abgehoben lol)

Over the course of my gap year I have made a lot of unique and interesting discoveries about myself and the world, I believe I could not have made any other way. A gap year was my opportunity to check off a few points on my bucket list before being to old and brittle ('!hide' Richtiges Wort??) to do so. While it may not have been as relaxing as I planned it out to be, I nonetheless would recommend everyone I know to take a gap year.

While the year began as I anticipated it to - cleaning up in pisa, helping a good cause and so on -, it didn't continue that way. I had planned to go the US next to help out in a nice place in Oregon (a town called Gravity Falls) and then go on to explore eastern Europe and western Asia, I ended up being caught in a nightmarish dimension for months and returned here, by a see-trough portal. Now, as you know, I returned here, right next to an erupting volcano, which - considering my health at the time - wasn't the best place to be stranded at. The wasteland stretched for miles and the topography didn't necessarily make it easier to traverse. But eventually, from the top of a hill, I discovered a scientific research station and was rescued.

I'm beginning to think I might be a little unlucky tho.

Anyways, reflecting on my gap year - I wouldn't see myself living it out another way. I have made friends, with the people in pisa and while I only narrowly did so, I survived a plane crash and a volcano, both of which were - in some absurd way - parts of my bucket list. And I generally feel like I gained the ability to apprechiate the simplistic nature of life.

## The future of my blog

"So", you might be wondering, "will this blog be continuing?". Well the answer will sadly be know, studying computer science isn't exactly the topic you would post about on a blog. The existing posts will stay online indefinetly as an epic tale of what happened in my gap year.
