## Plans

So, it's been 2 Days since my gap year has officially begun and I immediately booked the first flight to Pisa for a project I applied to a couple of months ago, the 'Pisa trash collection initiative', for which I intend to visit Pisa and explore it as well as helping a good cause.

## Travel

I arrived at Dusseldorf airport as expected and boarded the AirAir plane I had booked. As we took off, I looked out of the window, capturing a glimpse of the German countryside. As the plane took of, I fell victim to the soothing vibrations and the beautiful scenery and fell asleep.

The flight went smoothly, and hours alter I awoke as the plane set its wheels on the AirAir lane ('!hide'Do different companies have their own lanes???) at the Airport in Pisa.

## Exploration

As I stood outside the airport, I pulled out my phone to check the map and determine my next steps. The leaning tower of Pisa stood tall in the distance, looming over the place I would soon be helping clean up ('!hide'Zu blumig?).

I spent the first few weeks of my stay joining local volunteers for the trahs collection initivative in cleaning up the streets and parks near the tower.
Together, we worked tirelessly, picking up litter ('!hide'maybe use garbage instead?) and ensuring the surrounding area looked pristine ('!hide'maybe a little too much?).
It was a humbling experience, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction each time we filled another bag with discarded waste to be thrown away at the end of the day.

During my time working with other volunteers, I encountered multiple interesting figures, that had embarked on the same adventure I had, taking a gap year and exploring possibilities, that we would never be getting again.

## The Tower

Two months after first arriving in Pisa, on a sunny afternoon, after a long day of cleaning, I finally found myself standing in awe before the iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa.
It was a remarkable sight, defying gravity and standing as a testament to human ingenuity.

I took a moment to sit on a nearby bench, enjoying the majestic sight of the tower and the Piazza dei Miracoli ('!hide'Müssen da diese komischen striche drauf? Wenn ja, wie?).
In that moment, I realized that my gap year was about more than just adding lines to my CV. It was about embracing new experiences, connecting with others, and finding my place in the world.

We were told to store the trash beneath the tower, which I found a little odd, but after having put it in what looked to be a space underneath the towers foundations, not only was the trash gone, but the tower now stood straighter than before ('!hide'Sounds better -> remove hands from scene, könnte zeitlich knapp werden) and projected a majestic shadow on the ground below.

## Considerations for the future

As my three months in Pisa drew to a close, I reflected on how these few months had already felt like a lifetime of experiences. The culture I got to witness and the sense of purpose I felt were invaluable. While my time in Pisa was coming to an end, I knew that my gap year was far from over.

So, as I bid farewell to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, I boarded a plane to the US, ready to continue my journey and head towards a summer camp I planned to help out at while exploring the different national parks in the camps proximity. But just as the plane began to speed up, the floor came closer and closer until the planes nose was beneath it and began to fall ('!hide'-> Backrooms Artikel).

## Some photos

Here are some of the photos I made, one made the first time I saw the tower and one made at the same time of day from the same position when leaving again:('!hide' Much creative lol, a lot of real)

And here is the photo I made shortly before leaving pisa to ('!hide' explore new ???, nicht so dramatisch) pursue the other goals I had set for my gap year:

## TL;DR:

In the first few months of my gap year, I joined a project of volunteers to clean up Pisa while exploring the city. The flight to Pisa was smooth, and I joined local volunteers in collecting trash and beautifying the area near the iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was a humbling and satisfying experience, and I met fascinating individuals who were also taking a gap year. Finally, standing before the tower, I realized that my gap year was about more than just building my resume. As my time in Pisa came to an end, I reflected on the invaluable cultural experiences and sense of purpose I had gained. With newfound motivation I began the flight towards the US
