June 11th: Escape
Beginning Ende März (Überleitung hier rein)
## The Backrooms

('!hide'So I was sitting there, having boarded my plane to the US and looking forward to the 17 hour flight to the US as the planes nose ('!hide'heißt das Ding so???) began to descend into the ground a)

It's been a while since my last blog post, but let me tell you, my gap year so far has been nothing short of extraordinary. In my previous entry, I shared my experience of cleaning up trash in Pisa and how on the end of it - headed to the US - my plane fell straight trough the ground. At the time of writing this down on a piece of paper that I found in the remnants of the plane It's the middle of April and I've been stranded here for about 3 weeks

For those unfamiliar with the Backrooms, imagine a labyrinth of seemingly infinite, dimly lit rooms with peeling wallpaper and a strange, unsettling energy. It's a place that exists outside our reality, and somehow, I found myself stuck there without a visible exit for months.

Now, I wasn't alone in there, the people who were on the plane with me ended up in the Backrooms too. It was a crew of individuals from different backgrounds, with some being accepting of what hat happened and others wandering of into the infinite rooms, not being seen again for the duration of our stay. The few of us that stayed remotely sane stayed near the crash site and looted it.

Months passed, and the Backrooms became both a familiar and haunting place. We yearned for freedom, constantly searching for an escape route. As the remaining food began to run out we tirelessly walked trough the infinite corridiors, eventually seperating as the lack of food and repetitive hallways slowly drove us to madness.

As I was walking along the infinite rooms without any change in sight I heard a weird noise behind me, not daring to turn my head. I followed the infinite corridor in a hastle now, managing to open up my phone camera as I finally saw a green rectangle - a rectangle of the same color as the one shining on the roof of the room our plane arrived in. With the terrifying noises on the carpet coming ever so slightly closer to me I sprinted to the end of the corrior and flung myself into the almost tranprent rectangle.

I was planning on having my survival unknown until I remembered, that this paragraph wouldn't have been written if I weren't still alive. Sadly I am now located right at the foot of an erupting volcano in no mans land. You can find that story in the next entry
